This is a temporary repository to share code with other developers on the project. It will likely disappear shortly.

This code should soon be broken into three parts, a funtool part, a funtool-measures part, and a funtool-example part. All of these will be public repositories, also under and MIT License, so none of the code will disappear, but it will function slightly differently after a bit of refactoring.

In it's current state the code is a bit rough. If you'd like to use the tool instead of develop it, it's probably best to wait for a funtool release.
